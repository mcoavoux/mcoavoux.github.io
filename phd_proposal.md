​​​​​Starting date: between September and November 2024

Place of work: Laboratoire d'Informatique de Grenoble, CNRS, Grenoble, France

Duration of contract: 3 years

Contact: maximin.coavoux@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr

Mission: research oriented (teaching possible but not mandatory)

Description:

The SynPaX ANR project (Syntactic Parsing of Spontaneous speech with cross-modal
transfer learning) aims at investigating modal fusion systems to develop
end-to-end speech parsing models.
Most research on syntactic parsing of speech focused on parsing **transcriptions**,
and face two limitations: (i) the predicted transcriptions may be very noisy,
(i) they do not contain prosodic cues that are important to infer the syntactic structure.

A first end-to-end speech parsing model has been proposed by Pupier et al (2022) and evaluated on French spoken treebank Orféo.
The main issues of the model stems from: (i) the scarcity of training data (ii) the difficulty of parsing *spontaneous* speech.
Hence, the PhD project will build on this work to develop new methods for end-to-end dependency
parsing of speech. Potential research directions include:
- multilingual evaluation of Pupier et al's parser
- data augmentation methods (e.g. leveraging audio corpora with no syntactic annotation)
- investigate the use of multimodal pretrained models or modality fusion methods aimed to combine BERT-style models with wav2vec-style models.
- any research directions proposed by the applicant is most welcome (within the general topic of speech parsing).


Scientific environment:

The PhD will be conducted within the Getalp team of the LIG
laboratory (https://lig-getalp.imag.fr/). The GETALP team has a strong
expertise and track record in Natural Language Processing. The
recruited person will be welcomed within the team which offer a
stimulating, multinational and pleasant working environment.
The PhD will be supervised by Maximin Coavoux,
and Benjamin Lecouteux.


Salary: ~2000€ gross/month (social security included)

Profile:

- Master's degree in Computer Science / NLP / Computational Linguistics 
- background in NLP and/or speech processing
- Python (transformers, pytorch)
- Good communication skills in English. Rudimentary knowledge of French 
is welcome since it will be the focus language for the parsing experiments.

How to apply:

- please send CV + cover letter + recent (last ~2 years) academic
transcripts + master thesis (if available) to maximin.coavoux@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr
- deadline: April 8th
- Informal inquiries are welcome!
