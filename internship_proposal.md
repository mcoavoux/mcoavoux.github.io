Starting date: February or March 2024 (flexible)

Place of work: Laboratoire d'Informatique de Grenoble, CNRS, Grenoble, France

Duration: 6 months

Keywords: natural language processing, speech processing, dependency parsing, treebanks

Description:

The SynPaX ANR project (Syntactic Parsing of Spontaneous speech with cross-modal
transfer learning) aims at investigating modal fusions systems to develop
end-to-end speech parsing models, i.e. systems that work directly
on speech signal to perform parsing, instead of using only (potentially
noisy) speech transcriptions as input.

The two main bottlenecks in parsing speech are: (i) the scarcity
of the available training data (ii) the difficulty in transcribing spontaneous
speech. The internship will focus on (i) and explore data augmentation methods
by leveraging both audio corpora without syntactic annotations
and existing treebanks for written texts.

Tasks:

- literature review on speech parsing
- designing and implementing data augmentation methods for speech parsing
- empirical evaluation of proposed methods

Scientific environment:

The internship will be conducted within the Getalp team of the LIG
laboratory (https://lig-getalp.imag.fr/). The GETALP team has a strong
expertise and track record in Natural Language Processing. The
recruited person will be welcomed within the team which offer a
stimulating, multinational and pleasant working environment.
The internship will be supervised by Maximin Coavoux, Adrien Pupier
and Benjamin Lecouteux.

The SynPaX ANR project will also fund a PhD scholarship starting in Fall 2024 to
work on extensions of this internship.

Profile:

- be enrolled in a Master (M2) in NLP, computational linguistics or computer science
- background in NLP and/or speech processing
- proficiency in Python (transformers, pytorch)
- Good communication skills in English, rudimentary knowledge of French 
 is also expected since the internship will focus on French data.

How to apply:

- please send CV + cover letter + recent (last ~2 years) academic
transcripts to maximin <dot> coavoux <at> univ-grenoble-alpes.fr
